✅ Angular 17 – Core framework using standalone components (no NgModules).

✅ Angular Material – UI components like inputs, buttons, and forms.

✅ Reactive Forms – For form handling and validation.

✅ Vite – Fast build tool used instead of Angular CLI.

✅ json-server – Mock backend to store user data in db.json.

✅ HttpClient – For making API calls to json-server.

✅ Routing – Uses provideRouter() for navigation.

✅ Form validation – Built-in Validators ensure user input is correct.
